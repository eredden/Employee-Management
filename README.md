### Employee Management Program

This project was created for the [Computer Science 112 course](https://study.com/academy/course/computer-science-112-programming-in-c.html) on [Study.com](https://study.com). I did this to expand my knowledge of the C++ programming language as well as to pursue a college degree from Western Governor's University.

You can execute `build.sh` in the root directory of this project to build an executable. This may not work on Windows systems.
